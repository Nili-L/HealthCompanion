# HIPAA Compliance Guide

This document outlines the HIPAA compliance measures implemented in the Health Companion application.

## Overview

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that Protected Health Information (PHI) be secured both in transit and at rest. This application implements multiple security layers to maintain compliance.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Data Encryption

#### In Transit
- All API communications use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- Supabase connections enforce SSL
- No PHI transmitted over unencrypted channels

#### At Rest
- Supabase PostgreSQL encryption at rest enabled
- File storage uses encrypted buckets
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (via Supabase Auth)

### 2. Access Controls

#### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication support (configure via Supabase)
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Secure password requirements enforced

#### Authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Users can only access their own health data
- Provider access requires explicit patient consent
- Audit logs for all data access

### 3. Data Integrity

#### Validation
- Zod schemas validate all input data
- Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- File upload size limits and type restrictions

#### Audit Logging
- All PHI access logged with timestamps
- User actions tracked for compliance audits
- Logs stored separately from PHI

### 4. Privacy Controls

#### Minimum Necessary Standard
- Users control data visibility (legal name, gender identity)
- Granular sharing permissions for providers
- Data retention policies configurable

#### Patient Rights
- Right to access: Download all health records
- Right to amend: Update incorrect information
- Right to accounting: View access logs
- Right to restrict: Limit data sharing

## Implementation Checklist

### Administrative Safeguards
- [ ] Designate Privacy Officer
- [ ] Designate Security Officer
- [ ] Implement workforce training program
- [ ] Develop sanction policy for violations
- [ ] Create incident response plan
- [ ] Establish business associate agreements (BAAs)

### Physical Safeguards
- [ ] Secure server hosting (Supabase infrastructure)
- [ ] Device encryption for mobile/desktop apps
- [ ] Secure disposal of hardware containing PHI
- [ ] Facility access controls

### Technical Safeguards
- [x] Unique user authentication (Supabase Auth)
- [x] Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- [x] Encryption at rest (Supabase PostgreSQL)
- [x] Access controls (RLS policies)
- [x] Audit logging (implemented)
- [x] Automatic logoff (session timeout)
- [x] Data backup (Supabase automated backups)

## PHI Handling Guidelines

### What is PHI?
Protected Health Information includes:
- Names, addresses, phone numbers, emails
- Dates (birth, treatment, admission, discharge, death)
- Medical record numbers, insurance IDs
- Biometric identifiers
- Photos, videos, audio recordings
- Any other uniquely identifying information

### Developer Guidelines

1. **Never log PHI**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ BAD
   console.log('Patient data:', patientData);

   // ✅ GOOD
   console.log('Patient data loaded successfully');
   ```

2. **Sanitize error messages**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ BAD
   throw new Error(`Failed to save data for ${patient.name}`);

   // ✅ GOOD
   throw new Error('Failed to save patient data');
   ```

3. **Use environment variables**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use `.env` files (gitignored)
   - Rotate keys regularly

4. **Validate all inputs**
   ```typescript
   import { validateData, profileSchema } from '@/lib/validations';

   const result = validateData(profileSchema, userInput);
   if (!result.success) {
     // Handle validation errors
   }
   ```

5. **Implement error boundaries**
   ```typescript
   <ErrorBoundary>
     <HealthDataComponent />
   </ErrorBoundary>
   ```

## Data Retention

### Retention Periods
- Medical records: 6 years minimum (varies by state)
- Audit logs: 6 years minimum
- Billing records: 7 years minimum
- Authorization forms: 6 years after expiration

### Secure Deletion
- Use Supabase's hard delete functions
- Overwrite data before deletion
- Document deletion in audit logs
- Retain deletion records per policy

## Breach Notification

### Response Plan
1. **Immediate Actions** (< 24 hours)
   - Contain the breach
   - Secure systems
   - Document incident details
   - Notify Security Officer

2. **Assessment** (< 48 hours)
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify affected individuals
   - Assess risk to PHI

3. **Notification** (< 60 days)
   - Notify affected individuals
   - Report to HHS if > 500 individuals
   - Notify media if > 500 individuals in state
   - Document all notifications

### Breach Prevention
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing
- Employee training
- Access monitoring

## Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

### Required Services
The following third-party services require BAAs:

1. **Supabase** (Database & Auth)
   - Status: BAA available on Pro plan
   - Contact: https://supabase.com/hipaa

2. **Cloud Storage** (if used for files)
   - Ensure HIPAA-compliant storage provider
   - Obtain signed BAA before use

3. **Email Services** (if used for notifications)
   - PHI must not be included in emails
   - Or use HIPAA-compliant email service

### BAA Checklist
- [ ] Identify all business associates
- [ ] Obtain signed BAAs
- [ ] Review BAAs annually
- [ ] Terminate non-compliant vendors
- [ ] Maintain BAA records

## Compliance Monitoring

### Regular Audits
- Quarterly access log reviews
- Annual risk assessments
- Penetration testing (annually)
- Vulnerability scans (monthly)

### Metrics to Track
- Failed login attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Data export/download frequency
- Session timeout violations
- Encryption status

## Mobile & Desktop Apps

### Additional Considerations
1. **Device Security**
   - Require device PIN/biometric
   - Enable remote wipe capability
   - Encrypt local storage

2. **Offline Data**
   - Minimize PHI stored locally
   - Encrypt cached data
   - Clear cache on logout

3. **Updates**
   - Mandatory security updates
   - Auto-update enforcement
   - Deprecate old versions

## Testing in Development

### Use Synthetic Data Only
- Never use real patient data in development
- Generate realistic test data
- Clearly mark test environments
- Separate dev/staging/production databases

### Demo Accounts
- Mark demo data clearly
- Auto-expire demo accounts
- No PHI in demo data
- Reset demo data regularly

## Compliance Resources

2. Implement missing safeguards
3. Obtain HITRUST CSF certification (optional but recommended)
4. Maintain ongoing compliance monitoring
